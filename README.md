# Python Conditionals
&emsp; Demonstrates some of the basic uses of conditional statements.

# Task List:

### 1:
&emsp; Write a script that takes a user input. Use conditional statements to identify the following:<br>
&emsp; &emsp; Is the input a number?<br>
&emsp; &emsp; Is the number an integer?<br>
&emsp; &emsp; Is the number even or odd?<br>
&emsp; &emsp; If the number is less than 10, check if it's prime.

### 2:
&emsp; Ask the user for another input. Add the two inputs together if they can be added. Otherwise, print the reason they can't be.
